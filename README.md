## Motivation

Have you ever wanted a pet but realised that you are incapable of even taking care of yourself? Or maybe you have always seen the cool kids with their Tamagotchis and wanted one to pretend that you’re cool too? Perhaps you feel remorse for the Tamagotchis you have killed and wanted to repent for your sins. Inconceivably, you may even be seeking motivation to get your life in place!  

Well, you’re in luck!

## What makes us different from other platforms

Most virtual pet apps, such as Pou, focus on taking care of a pet, e.g. feeding, cleaning, sleeping, etc. While this may be fun and fulfilling, caring for a pet can feel tiresome when the novelty wears off, especially when life gets hectic. To set us apart, we have purposefully created a feature that enables you to pause your progress (the benefits of a virtual pet!) until you are ready to continue taking care of it

Virtual pet apps are mostly for entertainment, have little replay value and can be a time sink. Meanwhile, plain productivity apps such as Todolist require a lot of discipline and determination to use constantly. Our app targets these problems by combining entertainment with productivity, turning your pet into motivation so you can better incorporate it into your daily life.

Other productivity apps, such as Forest, improve productivity by whitelisting apps while our app HatchIt improves productivity and motivates by rewarding users who complete a task with coins and happiness for their pet. Furthermore, pets are also a better motivator than plants as users can interact and play with their pets.

## Aim

We wish to create a virtual pet through a web application that brings back nostalgia and improves productivity.

## User Stories

- As a student who lacks the motivation to study, I hope to be inspired to do work and be rewarded for it.
- As a student who wants to go back to a simpler time, I want to relive my childhood memories with this modern version of Tamagotchi.
- As a person who is unable to own a pet in real life, I hope to fill this void with a virtual pet.
