| 1    | I enjoyed looking at the pet animations and feeding it, but this app does depends on one's self discipline. However, it's still adorable and seeing the heartbroken pet does make me want to do something to make it happier! Perhaps there could be something similar to forest where there's a studying mode timer (it will be so cute to have the pet studying with you) to increase the productivity and screentime of the app! |                    |
| 2    | It's really cute! originally I thought it was just a pet, but now that I know that it's also a planner, I now have the incentive to keep checking on my pet even after the curiosity has passed so I won't stop using it.<br><br>although when I first started playing the rescue game I didn't know you were meant to click so it will be nice to have some instructions.                                                          |                    |
| 3    | It's really really cute but I wish there were a bit more instructions for certain features (e.g. I didn't know you had to drag the food). Maybe there could be a tutorial of some sorts when first using the features?                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                    |
